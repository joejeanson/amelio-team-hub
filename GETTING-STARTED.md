# Amelio — Getting Started

> 3 steps before the automated onboarding takes over.

## Prerequisites

- [**Windsurf IDE**](https://windsurf.com) installed
- **Git** installed (`git --version` to verify)
- **Azure DevOps PAT** — ask your lead (scopes needed: Code Read/Write, Packaging Read)

## 1. Clone the Team Hub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joejeanson/amelio-team-hub.git
```

## 2. Open the Workspace

In Windsurf: **File > Open Workspace from File** → select:

```
amelio-team-hub/windsurf/workspace/Template.code-workspace
```

## 3. Launch the Onboarding

In the **Cascade** chat panel, type:

```
/amelio-onboarding
```

Cascade will guide you through the rest — everything is automated from here.

## Need Help?
